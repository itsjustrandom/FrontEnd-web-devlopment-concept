# Client Storage Options for Web Development

## 1. Local Storage

* Stores data in the browser with no expiration date
* Data is stored as key-value pairs
* Storage limit is around 5MB
* Data is only accessible on the client-side
* Supported by all modern browsers
* Data is stored in plain text, not encrypted
* Can be accessed using JavaScript

## 2. Session Storage

* Stores data for a session (i.e., until the browser is closed)
* Data is stored as key-value pairs
* Storage limit is around 5MB
* Data is only accessible on the client-side
* Supported by all modern browsers
* Data is stored in plain text, not encrypted
* Can be accessed using JavaScript

## 3. Cookies

* Small text files stored on the client-side
* Sent with every HTTP request
* Can be used for authentication and tracking
* Storage limit is around 4KB
* Supported by all browsers, but has security and privacy concerns
* Can be set as HTTP-only (inaccessible to JavaScript) for added security
* Can be set with an expiration date or made session-based
* Can be secured with the Secure and SameSite attributes

## 4. IndexedDB

* A client-side database for storing structured data
* Supports transactions and versioning
* Storage limit is around 50MB (but can be increased)
* Data is only accessible on the client-side
* Supported by most modern browsers
* Data is stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON)
* Can be accessed using JavaScript

## 5. Web Storage (WebSQL)

* A client-side relational database
* Supports SQL queries
* Storage limit is around 5MB
* Data is only accessible on the client-side
* Deprecated and not recommended for new projects
* Data is stored in a relational format (e.g., tables)

## 6. Cache API

* Allows storing resources (e.g., images, scripts) for offline use
* Part of the Service Worker API
* Storage limit varies depending on the browser and device
* Supported by most modern browsers
* Data is stored as cached resources (e.g., images, scripts)

## 7. File System Access API

* Allows reading and writing files to the client's file system
* Supports reading and writing files, directories, and blobs
* Storage limit varies depending on the browser and device
* Supported by most modern browsers
* Data is stored as files on the client's file system

## 8. PWA (Progressive Web App) Storage

* Combination of Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cache API
* Used for storing data and resources for offline web applications
* Supported by most modern browsers
* Data is stored in a combination of key-value pairs, cached resources, and files

## 9. Client-side Storage Libraries

* Libraries like LocalForage, Dexie.js, and PouchDB provide a simpler API for storing data
* Often used for storing large amounts of data or complex data structures
* Supported by most modern browsers
* Data is stored in a variety of formats (e.g., JSON, relational)

## 10. Browser-specific Storage

* Some browsers offer additional storage options, such as:
	+ Firefox: `window.localStorage` and `window.sessionStorage`
	+ Safari: `window.localStorage` and `window.sessionStorage` (limited to 5MB)
	+ Edge: `window.localStorage` and `window.sessionStorage`
